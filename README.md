# SQL Hands-on Project on the Sport Formula 1

This project is a hands-on demonstration of using Oracle SQL to explore Formula 1 data. It provides a comprehensive guide to setting up an Oracle SQL environment and executing various SQL operations. The data used in this project was manually collected from [Formula 1's official website](https://www.formula1.com/) and [Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)](https://www.fia.com/), and is up to date as of the year 2022.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the step-by-step guide provided in the PDF. This guide includes instructions on downloading, installing, and setting up Oracle SQL on a Windows system. It also covers creating a new database, setting up tables, updating tables, and running SQL queries, complete with visual aids.

## Project Structure

This project consists of five tables:

1. **Teams**: Contains information about Formula 1 teams, including their standings in 2022 and 2021.
2. **Team Basic Info**: Provides essential details about each team, such as their full name, headquarters, chassis, power unit, and team chief.
3. **Team Stats**: Includes team statistics like entry year, world championships, highest race finish, pole positions, and fastest laps.
4. **Driver Stats**: Stores data on drivers, including their names, car numbers, team affiliations, podiums, Grand Prix starts, world championships, and highest race finish.
5. **Driver Info**: Contains driver information, such as their names, team affiliations, nationality, age, and the driver academy they graduated from.

## Executed Queries

In this project, we executed the following SQL queries:

1. **Show Top 5 Drivers with Most Win Percentage**: Lists the top 5 drivers with the highest win percentage, given they have at least 24 race starts.
2. **Teams with Most World Championships**: Identifies the teams with the most world championships.
3. **Driver Academies with Most Number of Drivers**: Displays driver academies with the highest number of affiliated drivers.
4. **Show Drivers with Most Experience and Points Scored by Them**: Highlights drivers with the most experience and the highest points scored.
5. **Select Driver Academies with Most World Championships**: Lists driver academies with the most world championships.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on demonstration of using Oracle SQL for basic and advanced SQL operations. It covers database setup, table creation, primary key and foreign key assignments, and executing complex SQL queries. Whether you are new to SQL or looking to expand your skills, this project will help you get familiarized with the basics of Oracle SQL and SQL Server.

Explore the project, learn SQL, and have fun exploring the exciting world of Formula 1!
